For my capston project I made a full stack site using html, css, and javascript.
If you wanted to mess around with some of my code, download the files into your vscode.
You'll need to run npm i and make sure nodemon is installed to your vscode.
You'll then need to run nodemon in your terminal.
Once you have done all of this just open the html file with live server.

Thats it, enjoy!
